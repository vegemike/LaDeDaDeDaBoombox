If you hate my music taste which is fair and want YOUR OWN SONGS on the radio it's almost straightforward

You need:

Some IDE

Competence


Fix the csproj file so it matches your system (sorry i dont really know how to make it work properly)

Take your songs as OGG and put them in /Assets/

Set them to build as an embedded resource

Build the file

DLL will be somewhere, probably /bin/debug/.../


If you know how to do this better you can let me know thanks


currently working on getting all clients to play the same song
